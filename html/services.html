<p/>Here are some services I can offer you with EXCELLENT WORKMANSHIP! Also I am insured and can provide paperwork if needed.

<p/>I build all my decks between $15-$22 a square foot, depending on how high or low from the ground the deck is, if it is composite, cedar, pressure treated or your own design.

<p/>I can:

<ul>
    <li>Give free estimates for a brand new deck or repair an old deck to new.</li>
    <li>Build the deck to your preferred custom meaning, build exactly what you want with custom flooring, railing, stairs and balusters.</li>
    <li>Build a simple average deck, meaning the basic deck that is actually built correctly and will last 15-20 years if maintained correctly. Instead of 5-10 years by having it done wrong! I get permits for every deck I do.</li>
</ul>

<p/>Custom Decks & Repairs LLC takes the time to build it right the first time.

<p/>Basic normal deck construction consist of:

<ul>
    <li>6x6 treated columns</li>
    <li>2-2x10 or 2x12 treated beam</li>
    <li>2x8 or larger treated joist boards</li>
    <li>2x6 treated decking for floor of deck (not 5/4x6 board because, it doesn't last even close as long)</li>
    <li>4x4 or 6x6 treated railing post</li>
    <li>2x2 treated balusters, aluminum spindles, composite 2x2 or vinyl</li>
    <li>2x6 treated cap railing sanded for smooth grip and routed edge for a nice clean look</li>
</ul>
